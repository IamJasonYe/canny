# Canny_edgeDetector
## About the project 

This is a project based on the lecture, *Digital System and Design* , by Prof. Wang. It aims at implementing a hardware architecture to boost the speed of computation by parallel design and some tricks of optimization to achieve the real-time video analysis goal. 

So far, it has achieved the Python version for simulation.
